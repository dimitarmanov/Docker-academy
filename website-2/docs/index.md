title: What is Grid.js?
---

Grid.js is a table plugin written in TypeScript. 

<center>
    <img src='/img/logo.svg' width="200" style={{margin: "25px"}} />
</center>

It is developed to be used with all popular JavaScript frameworks
include **React**, **Angular.js**, **Vue** or without any frameworks!

 - Small. Only 12kb with all plugins (minified and gzipped)
 - Fast! Grid.js has an internal pipeline that takes care of caching and processing data
 - Works with all web frameworks
 - Supports all modern web-browsers
 - No vendor lock-in
 - MIT licensed and Free!

Grid.js uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) under the hood to render the templates (Note: but it **can** be used with any JavaScript frameworks) 
and employs a minimal Flux architecture to communicate with other components.
